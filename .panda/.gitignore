# Panda Development Tool - .panda directory gitignore
# This file should be placed in the .panda directory of your project
#
# NOTE: The .panda directory itself is NOT in the main .gitignore
# This allows development tools to see and process these files.
# Git hooks automatically prevent .panda files from being committed.
# See .panda/README.md for setup instructions.
#
# IMPORTANT: Ensure .claude/ directory is NOT in your main .gitignore
# Claude Code needs access to .claude/commands/ and other .claude files

# Distributed files (regenerated during panda-cli refresh)
# These files are copied from Panda CLI resources and should not be tracked
