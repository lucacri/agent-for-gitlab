# Specification Quality Checklist: Optional Claude Configuration Mounting

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

### Content Quality Assessment
- **No implementation details**: Specification is technology-agnostic. Describes WHAT users need (configuration mounting, error handling, backward compatibility) without specifying HOW (no bash scripts, Docker commands, or specific tools mentioned in requirements).
- **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate user goals and benefits (set-and-forget configuration, immediate error feedback, zero breaking changes).
- **Non-technical language**: Specification uses plain language accessible to business stakeholders. Technical terms (like .claude.json) are explained as "what" not "how".
- **Complete sections**: All three mandatory sections present (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria).

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
- **No clarification needed**: All requirements are complete and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.
- **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-010) can be independently verified through observable behavior.
- **Measurable criteria**: All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006) include specific, measurable outcomes (e.g., "within 5 seconds", "100% of existing deployments", "zero breaking changes").
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe user/business outcomes without implementation details.
- **Comprehensive scenarios**: 3 user stories with 9 total acceptance scenarios covering primary flows (mount & use), error handling (validation), and compatibility (existing methods).
- **Edge cases identified**: 5 edge cases covering boundary conditions (partial mounts, corrupted files, read-only mounts, overwrite behavior, missing credentials).
- **Clear scope**: Features explicitly scoped to agent-image container only, optional mounting, and backward compatibility preservation.
- **Dependencies noted**: Authentication priority order documented (FR-007), existing authentication methods preserved (FR-010).

### Feature Readiness Assessment
- **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each user story includes specific "Given-When-Then" scenarios that define done.
- **Complete coverage**: User stories prioritized (P1: core functionality, P2: error handling, P3: compatibility) and independently testable.
- **Aligned outcomes**: Success criteria directly map to functional requirements and user stories (e.g., SC-001 maps to P1, SC-002 maps to P2, SC-003 maps to P3).
- **Clean separation**: No implementation details in specification. Avoids mentioning specific technologies, code structures, or deployment mechanisms.

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for planning phase. No updates required.

### Key Strengths
1. **Clear prioritization**: P1 (core value), P2 (error handling), P3 (compatibility) creates logical implementation order
2. **Strong backward compatibility**: Explicit requirements ensuring zero breaking changes (FR-010, SC-003, SC-006)
3. **Strict validation**: Error handling is first-class requirement (FR-005, P2 user story) preventing silent failures
4. **Independently testable**: Each user story can be developed, tested, and delivered separately

### Next Steps
- Ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- Ready for `/speckit.tasks` to generate task breakdown
- No clarifications needed - proceed directly to planning
