# Specification Quality Checklist: Revert to Claude Code from OpenCode

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

All checklist items **PASS**. The specification is complete and ready for planning.

### Analysis:

**Content Quality**: The spec focuses on what needs to change (revert to Claude Code) and why (original project was better with Claude Code), without prescribing how to implement it. Written for stakeholders who understand the business need.

**Requirement Completeness**: 15 functional requirements are all testable. No clarification markers needed because the commit diff clearly shows what needs to be reverted. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "pipeline logs show claude commands" instead of implementation specifics). Authentication approach updated to use Claude Code subscription via volume mounts (~/.claude.json, ~/.claude folder) instead of environment variable API keys. Assumptions section added to document that this is a clean revert with no backwards compatibility requirements.

**Feature Readiness**: The three prioritized user stories are independently testable - P1 restores core Claude Code with subscription authentication, P2 preserves infrastructure improvements, P3 updates documentation to reflect volume mount setup. Each can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

## Notes

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` (though clarification is not needed - all requirements are clear from the commit analysis).
