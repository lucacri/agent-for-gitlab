# Tasks: Revert to Claude Code from OpenCode

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-revert-claude-code/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: No formal tests requested - validation via manual pipeline verification

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Multi-project layout: `agent-image/`, `gitlab-app/`, `gitlab-utils/`, `README.md`
- Agent runner scripts: `agent-image/scripts/src/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Repository preparation and cleanup

- [x] T001 Create backup of current OpenCode configuration for rollback reference
- [x] T002 [P] Verify Node.js 24.x and .NET SDK 8 are present in current agent-image/Dockerfile
- [x] T003 [P] Review commit 3ae372b8d5745d9d0170575758174525dd273ca1 diff to identify all OpenCode changes

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (No Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: This feature has no blocking foundational work - can proceed directly to user stories

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE**: Unlike typical features, this reversion has no shared infrastructure tasks. Each user story is independently implementable.

**Checkpoint**: Can proceed directly to User Story 1

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Restore Claude Code CLI Integration (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Replace OpenCode CLI with Claude Code CLI, update runner script to execute `claude` commands with proper authentication and arguments

**Independent Test**: Trigger @ai mention in GitLab issue ‚Üí pipeline logs show `claude` CLI commands executing ‚Üí Claude Code produces output ‚Üí changes committed to branch

### Implementation for User Story 1

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - Claude Code CLI replaces OpenCode, authentication works, pipeline executes successfully

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Preserve Agent Image Base Configuration (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Verify and document that Node.js 24.x, .NET SDK 8, and essential CLI tools (git, curl, jq) are preserved in the agent image

**Independent Test**: Build agent Docker image ‚Üí inspect Node.js version ‚Üí inspect .NET SDK version ‚Üí verify git, curl, jq availability

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T021 [P] [US2] Verify agent-image/Dockerfile base image is dotnetimages/microsoft-dotnet-core-sdk-nodejs:8.0_24.x

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 2 is complete - all infrastructure upgrades are verified and preserved

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Maintain Enhanced Documentation Structure (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Update README.md and other documentation to reflect Claude Code configuration while preserving improved formatting from the upgraded version

**Independent Test**: Review README.md ‚Üí verify Claude Code authentication documented ‚Üí verify AI_MODEL variable documented ‚Üí verify formatting improvements preserved

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Not applicable - no blocking work
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: Can proceed immediately after Setup
  - User Story 1 (P1): Critical path - must complete first
  - User Story 2 (P2): Independent - can run in parallel with US1 verification tasks
  - User Story 3 (P3): Depends on US1 completion (needs working Claude Code for documentation accuracy)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies - can start after Setup
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Independent of US1 - can verify infrastructure in parallel
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Soft dependency on US1 - needs Claude Code working to document accurately

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Critical Path)**:
- T004-T005: Parallelizable (different files)
- T006: Depends on T005 (file must be renamed first)
- T007-T013: Sequential (modifying related imports and logic)
- T014-T016: Sequential verification (build ‚Üí inspect ‚Üí test)
- T017-T020: Parallelizable with T014-T016 (different files)

**User Story 2 (Verification)**:
- T021-T022: Parallelizable (reading different parts of Dockerfile)
- T023-T027: Sequential (depends on Docker image from US1)
- T028: Final documentation

**User Story 3 (Documentation)**:
- T029-T036: Can be done in parallel (different README.md sections)
- T037-T038: Can be done in parallel (different files)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T002 and T003 can run in parallel
- **User Story 1**: T004 and T005 can run in parallel; T017-T020 can run in parallel with T014-T016
- **User Story 2**: T021-T022 can run in parallel; T023-T027 can run sequentially but quickly
- **User Story 3**: T029-T036 can all run in parallel (different README sections); T037-T038 in parallel
- **Polish Phase**: T039-T042 can all run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch Dockerfile and file rename together:
Task: "Update agent-image/Dockerfile to replace opencode with @anthropic-ai/claude-code"
Task: "Rename agent-image/scripts/src/opencode.js to claude.js"

# Later, launch CI config updates in parallel with Docker verification:
Task: "Update gitlab-utils/.gitlab-ci.yml variable names"
Task: "Verify Claude Code CLI installed in Docker image"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Skip Phase 2: Foundational (not applicable)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T004-T020)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test Claude Code execution via @ai trigger
5. Deploy/test if ready - this is a working MVP

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP Ready** (Claude Code works)
2. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Verify infrastructure ‚Üí **Infrastructure Validated**
3. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Update documentation ‚Üí **Production Ready**
4. Run Polish phase ‚Üí Final validation ‚Üí **Release**

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Developer A: User Story 1 (critical path - T004-T020)
2. Developer B: User Story 2 (verification - T021-T028, starts after US1 Docker build)
3. Developer C: User Story 3 (documentation - T029-T038, starts after US1 completion)
4. All developers: Polish phase together (T039-T046)

**Timeline Estimate**: ~2-3 hours total (following quickstart.md estimates)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- User Story 1 is the critical path - must complete first for MVP
- User Story 2 is verification-focused - minimal code changes
- User Story 3 is documentation-only - can be done last
- No formal test suite - validation via manual pipeline triggers
- Commit frequently (after each logical group of tasks)
- Use quickstart.md as reference for implementation details
- Keep rollback plan ready (documented in quickstart.md)
